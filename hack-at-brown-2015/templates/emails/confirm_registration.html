<p>Hey {{name}},</p>
<p>
	We just got your application for Hack@Brown. We can't wait to see what you'll build.

	We might not have room for everyone—we'll send you an email regarding your acceptance as the hackathon gets closer. Don't worry—we aren't selecting people based on technical skill alone.
