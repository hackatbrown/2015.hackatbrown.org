<h1>You've been accepted to Hack@Brown!</h1>
<p>Hey,</p>
<p>
	We're always sad we can't admit everyoneâ€”but we're also really excited to say you've made the list. We can't wait to see what you build.
</p>
<p>
	We're gonna need you to RSVP if you can go within 7 days.
</p>
<p>
	If you're not coming, you should let us know so that we can admit someone from the waitlist.
</p>

<p>
	<a class='cta'>RSVP or cancel</a>
</p>
