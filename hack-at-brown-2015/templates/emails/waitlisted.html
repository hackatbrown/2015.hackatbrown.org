<p>Hey,</p>
<p>
	Thanks for applying to Hack@Brown. Unfortunately, we can't offer you a spot just yet—we got so many great applications, and we just didn't have enough. There's still a chance you could get in, though—there are always people who don't RSVP, and we'll let someone off the waitlist the second we're able to.
</p>
<p>
	If you're a Providence-area student, we still admit a fair number of local hackers on the day of the event, so stay tuned to our Twitter (@hackatbrown) and <a href='https://www.facebook.com/hackatbrown'>Facebook page</a>.
</p>
